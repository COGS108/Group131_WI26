    "How does borrower income, employment length, home ownership status, and intent of loan affect the probability of a loan being defaulted?\n",
    "\n",
    "The study focuses on the correlation between the binary outcome variable loan_status, where loan_status =1 indicates a borrower has failed to pay off (defaulted), while the loan_status= 0 indicates repayment as agreed. Utilizing numerous descriptive statistics, such as with mean and median, the study attempts to summarize borrower and loan characteristics from the data set as well as use group comparisons via calculating the default rate across the categories of home ownership and loan intent to better be able to identify difference in default risk between groups while applying logistic regression, to model to the audience the probability of loan default as a function to person_income, person_emp_length,person_home_ownership, and loan_intent and whether the variables play a factor in the probability of the binary outcome variable loan_status being defaulted."

Within each group of loan statuses, we need quantitative and categorical data labels like income, expenses, house ownership status, loan intents, loan amounts, interest rates, age, etc associated with every entry in the dataset. The data would be collected at the time of loan origination and through self reported entries that are verified by tax documents to ensure the validity of the data. The data would consists of entries from people from ages 20 to 40 who have income.

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [x] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> This project uses a publicly available, secondary dataset. Our team did not collect data directly from human subjects, so informed consent was not obtained by us. We assume informed consent and ethical data collection practices were handled by the original data providers.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "> We acknowledge that collection bias may exist if certain borrower groups, such as higher income or more stable employment groups, are overrepresented in the dataset. This may limit how well the results generalize to all borrowers, so findings are interpreted cautiously.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "> The dataset does not contain direct personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, or identification numbers. All variables used are anonymized and relevant to the analysis, minimizing exposure to PII.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The dataset does not include protected attributes such as race or gender, which limits our ability to test downstream bias across these groups. We acknowledge this limitation and avoid making claims about fairness across unobserved protected classes.\n",

    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [x] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [x] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [x] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [x] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    " - [x] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    " - [x] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [x] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [x] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [x] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [x] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [x] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [x] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [x] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [x] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [x] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [x] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [x] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"

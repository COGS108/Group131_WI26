    "How does borrower income, employment length, home ownership status, and intent of loan affect the probability of a loan being defaulted?\n",
    "\n",
    "The study focuses on the correlation between the binary outcome variable loan_status, where loan_status =1 indicates a borrower has failed to pay off (defaulted), while the loan_status= 0 indicates repayment as agreed. Utilizing numerous descriptive statistics, such as with mean and median, the study attempts to summarize borrower and loan characteristics from the data set as well as use group comparisons via calculating the default rate across the categories of home ownership and loan intent to better be able to identify difference in default risk between groups while applying logistic regression, to model to the audience the probability of loan default as a function to person_income, person_emp_length,person_home_ownership, and loan_intent and whether the variables play a factor in the probability of the binary outcome variable loan_status being defaulted."

    "The ideal dataset we would want to answer the research question would have to contain a significantly large amount of data entries (at least 10,000) since a loan default is relatively uncommon. Within each group of loan statuses, we need quantitative and categorical data labels like income, expenses, house ownership status, loan intents, loan amounts, interest rates, age, etc associated with every entry in the dataset. The data would be collected at the time of loan origination and through self reported entries that are verified by tax documents to ensure the validity of the data. The data would consists of entries from people from ages 20 to 40 who have income.

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> This project uses a publicly available, secondary dataset. Our team didn't collect data directly from human subjects, so informed consent was not obtained by us. We assume informed consent and ethical data collection practices were handled by the original data providers.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "> We acknowledge that collection bias may exist if certain borrower groups, such as higher income or more stable employment groups, are overrepresented in the dataset. This may limit how well the results generalize to all borrowers, so findings are interpreted cautiously.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "> The dataset doesm't contain direct personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, or identification numbers. All variables used are anonymized and relevant to the analysis, minimizing exposure to PII.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The dataset fits the research question and doesn’t include protected attributes like race or gender. Whether more bias checks are needed depends on what the results show. If differences show up across groups in the data, that would mean taking a closer look. Overall, the data used works for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?  \n",
    "\n",
    "> The dataset is publicly available from Kaggle and stored locally by group members for this class project. The data is anonymized and doesn’t include sensitive personal information, so the security risk is low.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Since the dataset is open-source and publicly available, individual data removal requests can’t be handled by our group.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?  \n",
    "\n",
    "> While the dataset remains publicly available, local copies used for this project can be deleted after the course is finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?  \n",
    "\n",
    "> The analysis mainly looks at numerical and categorical features. Perspectives from borrowers or lenders are not directly included, so some personal factors behind loan default may not be fully captured.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Loan default happens less often than repayment, which creates an imbalance in the data. Some factors that affect default, like full credit history, are also missing, which may affect the results.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Visualizations and summary statistics are created to show the data clearly and accurately. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?  \n",
    "\n",
    "> The dataset is anonymized and doesn't include personal identifying information. All analysis will be done at a group level.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?  \n",
    "\n",
    "> The analysis is written as drafts with clear code and explanations, making it possible to rerun or review later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Some features like income or home ownership may indirectly relate to sensitive factors. Results are interpreted carefully and are used to study patterns, not judge individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Comparisons are made across available groups such as loan intent and home ownership. Fairness testing is limited since protected attributes aren't included in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Since the outcome is binary, classification metrics are used. Class imbalance is kept in mind when evaluating model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Logistic regression is used so the relationship between features and loan default can be explained in a straightforward way.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Model limitations such as missing variables and possible bias are explained when presenting the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed?  \n",
    "\n",
    "> This model is not deployed, but a real version would need regular checks to make sure results stay reasonable over time.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results?  \n",
    "\n",
    "> In real-world use, loan decisions should include human review and a way for people to question or appeal outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Any real deployment should allow the model to be turned off if problems or unfair outcomes appear.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?  \n",
    "\n",
    "> A possible unintended use of this model would be applying it directly to loan approval decisions. Since the analysis is based on limited features and an open dataset, results could be misleading or unfair if used in practice. For this project, the model is only used for analysis and learning, and any real deployment would require additional data and monitoring.\n",

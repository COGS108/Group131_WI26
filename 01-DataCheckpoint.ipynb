        "Credit risk assessment is the fundamental process used by financial institutions to predict the likelihood that a borrower will fail to meet their debt obligation. In the modern economy, lenders have moved away from simple credit score checks toward comprehensive risk modeling that analyzes a combination of “capacity” (a borrower’s ability to pay) and “stability” (their profession and residential history). As financial services become increasingly digitized, research highlights a transition from manual reviews toward automated Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) architectures to identify which specific borrower attributes such as annual income and employment tenure act as the most reliable anchors for financial responsibility [1](https://www.mdpi.com/1911-8074/18/9/520).\n",
        "\n",
        "Previous work in this field has shown that housing status and the specific intent of a loan are major predictors of default behavior (the failure of a borrower to fulfill their legal obligations to repay a debt according to agreed-upon terms). Research into consumer default has consistently demonstrated that homeowners are statistically less likely to default compared to renters, as property ownership suggests a level of financial stability and collateral that mitigates risk [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9041570/). Furthermore previous data science projects utilizing credit risk datasets have discovered that \"loan intent\" acts as a crucial qualitative filter; for instance, loans intended for education or home improvement often have different repayment trajectories than those intended for high-interest debt consolidation. What these earlier projects really showed is that you can't just look at a person’s background by itself; you have to look at their demographics alongside the actual reason they’re taking out the loan in the first place.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) shows that a borrower’s age is a major factor in how they handle debt, especially as they transition through different life stages. Their research highlights that younger borrowers often have much higher delinquency rates, likely because they have shorter credit histories and less financial experience compared to older generations/older borrowers [3](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-credit-trends/student-loans/lending-borrower-age/). By looking at these age-based trends, we can see that risk isn't just about how much money someone makes, but also where they are in their life and their age. This is really important for our project because it helps explain why younger people who might still be in the early stages of their careers are often flagged as higher risk even if they have a steady income.\n",
        "\n",
        "To model these outcomes, researchers predominantly utilize Logistic Regression. While more complex algorithms exist, recent literature emphasizes that Logistic Regression remains a preferred tool for credit risk because it provides a \"probability score\" that is easily interpretable for regulatory audits [1](https://www.mdpi.com/1911-8074/18/9/520). This method allows analysts to see exactly how much specific variables, such as a higher loan-to-income ratio or a change in housing status, mathematically increase the probability of a binary \"default\" outcome. Our project builds on this existing research by using these established statistical methods to determine the predictive power of income, employment, housing status, and loan intent.\n",

        "### A. Data Collection\n",
        " - [x] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
        "\n",
        "> This project uses a publicly available, secondary dataset. Our team did not collect data directly from human subjects, so informed consent was not obtained by us. We assume informed consent and ethical data collection practices were handled by the original data providers.\n",
        "\n",
        " - [x] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
        "> We acknowledge that collection bias may exist if certain borrower groups, such as higher income or more stable employment groups, are overrepresented in the dataset. This may limit how well the results generalize to all borrowers, so findings are interpreted cautiously.\n",
        "\n",
        " - [x] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
        "> The dataset doesn't contain direct personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, or identification numbers. All variables used are anonymized and relevant to the analysis, minimizing exposure to PII.\n",
        "\n",
        " - [x] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
        "\n",
        "> The dataset doesn't include protected attributes such as race or gender, which limits our ability to test downstream bias across these groups. We acknowledge this limitation and avoid making claims about fairness across unobserved protected classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### B. Data Storage\n",
        "- [x] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
        "> The data used in this project comes from open-source Kaggle datasets and does not contain sensitive or private information. We store the data locally and in GitHub/Colab environments, which already include standard access controls.\n",
        "\n",
        "- [x] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
        "> Since the datasets are publicly available and fully anonymized, there is no direct way to trace data back to an individual. If a dataset were removed from Kaggle, we would stop using it.\n",
        "\n",
        "- [x] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
        "> The data is only kept for the duration of this class project. After the project is complete, the local copies can be deleted since the original data remains publicly available on Kaggle.\n",
        "### C. Analysis\n",
        "- [x] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
        "> The analysis is based on available loan and borrower data and does not directly include perspectives from borrowers or lenders. Because of this, some real-world factors behind loan default may not be fully captured, and results are interpreted with this limitation in mind.\n",
        "\n",
        "- [x] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
        "> Loan default is less common than repayment, which creates class imbalance in the dataset. Some potentially important factors, such as full credit history, are also not included, which may affect the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "- [x] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
        "> Our visualizations and summary statistics are created to reflect the data accurately.\n",
        "\n",
        "- [x] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
        "> The dataset is anonymized and does not include personally identifiable information. All analysis is done at an aggregate level without exposing individual data points.\n",
        "\n",
        "- [x] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
        "> The analysis is documented in a notebook with clear code and explanations, making it possible to rerun or review the process if issues are found later.\n",
        "\n",
        "### D. Modeling\n",
        "- [x] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
        "> The model uses variables such as income, employment length, home ownership, and loan intent. While these factors may indirectly relate to sensitive attributes, they are included to study patterns in loan default and not to make judgments about individuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "- [x] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
        "> Comparisons are made across available groups in the data, such as loan intent and home ownership status. However, fairness testing is limited because protected attributes like race or gender are not included.\n",
        "\n",
        "- [x] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
        "> Since the outcome variable is binary, appropriate classification metrics are used. Class imbalance is also considered when evaluating model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- [x] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
        "> Logistic regression is used so that the relationship between input variables and loan default can be explained in a clear and interpretable way.\n",
        "\n",
        "- [x] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
        "> Limitations such as missing variables, potential bias, and dataset constraints are clearly discussed alongside the model results.\n",
        "\n",
        "### E. Deployment\n",
        "- [x] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
        "> This model is not deployed in a real-world setting and is only used for this class project. If it were to be deployed, regular monitoring and review would be needed to ensure performance stays reasonable over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "- [x] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
        "> In a real application, loan decisions should involve human review and a way for individuals to question or appeal outcomes. This helps reduce harm from incorrect or unfair predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "- [x] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
        "> Any real deployment should allow the model to be turned off or replaced if issues such as bias or poor performance are discovered.\n",
        "\n",
        "- [x] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
        "> A possible unintended use would be applying the model directly to loan approval decisions. Since the model is built using limited features and open data, using it without proper safeguards could lead to unfair outcomes."
